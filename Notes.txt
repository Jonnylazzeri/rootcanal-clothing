Section 5:

When we statrt the react app: these are the things we can remove:

  1. The serviceWorker method from index.js
  
  2. We don't need anything from the App componenet except for the div element (just the div, nothing thats already nested inside it.)

  3. We don't need any of the app CSS (don't delete the file, just the contents)


Lock Files are used since our project most likely will not be running from our computer. We'll most likely upload the project ot a server after we are done with it.
Our lock file will make sure that all of our packages have their relevant dependencies in order to work.

In order to pass in dynamic js properties into the style attribute of a jsx element, we would have to use template strings:

   const MenuItem = ({title, imageUrl}) => (
    <div style={{
      backgroundImage: `url(${imageUrl})`
    }}className= 'menu-item'>

React is just a UI library, which is why we have to route ouselves.
The browser provides something called a history API, and internally, libraries like ract router, use this API to hijack and mimic URLs.

To enable the app componenet to route, we would have to next it inside <BrowserRouter> inside the index.js file

    ReactDOM.render(
    <BrowserRouter>
        <App />
    </BrowserRouter>,
    document.getElementById('root')
  );


In order to use Routing within the app (in a precise way), we would have to import Route from react-router-dom:

  import { Route } from 'react-router-dom'

And then we would have to give the route three props:
  path: where we specify the "url" we want to route to.
  componenet: which is the componenet that's supposed to be in the url. For instance, HomePage is going to be inside our root, since it is the main page of the application.
  exact: a boolean, which specifies if the path has to be the exact path that is specified, or if it could just be a path that contains that path (for instance /hats contains a '/', so it will be outputted along with our hats page if we don't specify the exact prop).

    function App() {
    return (
      <div>
        <Route exact path='/' component={HomePage}/>
        <Route exact path='/hats' component={HatsPage}/>
      </div>
    );
  }

If Switch finds a path that is a match to any of the Routes nested inside it, it will not render anything else but that route.
Unless of course, exact is specified, and then it will just redirect to that route.


The params property inside the Route componenet is an object of URL Parameters.
url parameters or route paramters will look like: :topicId. This will make our url dynamic, and whatever comes after the path: '/topics/:topicId' will be logged as a parameter. 

For instance if we write: '/topics/13' ... 13 will now be entered as the value for the topicId parameter.

The Link component is a special component that the react-router-dom gives us, that lets us dynamically pass in an attribute of "to", which will specify where to take us to. For example:

  <Link to='/topics'>TOPICS</Link>

This will give you a link that will direct you to the page you want to reach, instead of manually inserting the url you want to reach everytime.

React is a single page application, so it is not redirecting us and rebuilding the entire application everytime the url changes.

If instead of a link we wanted to use a button, we would have to use the history prop:

  <button onClick= {() => props.history.push('/topics)}> Topics </button>

This gives us more freedom to control when we want this to work. For instance, we can use this on a componentDidMount, but we couldn't use a <Link>

The location prop tells us where we are currently. This prop inside the location is called the pathname.

The main usage of match is building a dynamic url:

const TopicList = props => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1> Topic List Page </h1>
      <Link to{`${props.match.url}/13`}>To Topic 13</Link>
      <Link to{`${props.match.url}/17`}>To Topic 17</Link>
      <Link to{`${props.match.url}/21`}>To Topic 21</Link>
    </div>
  )
}

By wrapping components inside the withRouter function, we can get access to everything the router gets access to (location, history, etc.), which otherwise, would be impossible, unless it was the first parent component (homepage) of the application.

This: 

  render() {
      return (
        <div className= 'directory-menu'>
          {
            this.state.sections.map(({title, imageUrl, id, size}) => (
              <MenuItem key={id} title = {title} imageUrl={imageUrl} size = {size} />
            ))  
          }
        </div>
      )
    }

is equivalent to: 

  render() {
      return (
        <div className= 'directory-menu'>
          {
            this.state.sections.map(({id, ...otherSectionProps}) => (
              <MenuItem key={id} {...otherSectionProps} />
            ))  
          }
        </div>
      )
    }


Redux: 

in order to install redux in react, we will have to enter the node.js code:

yarn add redux redux-logger react-redux

Aftwerwards, we insert our redux into the index.js file like this:
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';

The provider is a component that is a component that is the parent of everything inside of our application. As the parent, it allows us to get access to all of the things related to the store, that we're going to put all of the actual code we want to store on our redux state.

We wrap the provider around the entire index.js: 

ReactDOM.render(
  <Provider>
    <BrowserRouter>
        <App />
    </BrowserRouter>
  </Provider>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);

After writing the provider down, we would have to write the store itself, by making a new folder in src called redux (where all the code related to our redux is going to be).

The first file we will create is the root reducer, which will be the code that will bind all of our states together.

We will later add the user folder and user-reducer.js file. A reducer is a function that gets two properties. It gets a state object, which represents the last state or the initial state, and then it receives an action.

The action just has a type and payload value:

{
  type: 
  payload:
}

The reducer is a function

The initial state: 

const INITIAL_STATE =  {
  currentUser: null
}

The updated state:

const [state, dispatch] = (state, action) => {

}

We could also do the updated ES6 version of this, since you can enter a default value in the state, if it ever comes back as undefined:

const [state, dispatch] = (state = INITIAL_STATE, action) => {

}

null is considered a value, yet undefined is not.


const [state, dispatch] = (state = INITIAL_STATE, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'SET_CURRENT_USER':
      return {
        ...state,
        currentUser: action.payload
      }

    default:
      return state;
  }
}

Depending on what the action is, the switch statement will check if the case for the action.type is equal to SET_CURRENT_USER, we want to return the new object in the return (out of the reducer function).
If it's not, we just want to return the default state.

Later we add : 

import { combineReducers } from 'redux'

to the root reducer.



import userReducer from './user/user-reducer'

export default combineReducers ({
  user: userReducer
})

The next file we need to create is the store.js

import { createStore, applyMiddleWare } from 'redux';

The middleware catches the action that was instantiated and moves it along.


const middleWares = [logger];

const store = createStore(rootReducer, applyMiddleWare(...middleWares))

After exporting store, we're going to need to import it to index.js.

import store from './redux/store';

ReactDOM.render(
  <Provider store={store}>

With our code written with all the previous steps, we now have access to redux in our application.

We have to make sure we always align the action creator's type with the reducer's type expectation in order to create the appropriate effects on the reducer.
