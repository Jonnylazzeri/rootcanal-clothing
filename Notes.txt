When we statrt the react app: these are the things we can remove:

  1. The serviceWorker method from index.js
  
  2. We don't need anything from the App componenet except for the div element (just the div, nothing thats already nested inside it.)

  3. We don't need any of the app CSS (don't delete the file, just the contents)


Lock Files are used since our project most likely will not be running from our computer. We'll most likely upload the project ot a server after we are done with it.
Our lock file will make sure that all of our packages have their relevant dependencies in order to work.

In order to pass in dynamic js properties into the style attribute of a jsx element, we would have to use template strings:

   const MenuItem = ({title, imageUrl}) => (
    <div style={{
      backgroundImage: `url(${imageUrl})`
    }}className= 'menu-item'>
