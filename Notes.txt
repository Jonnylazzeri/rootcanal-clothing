When we statrt the react app: these are the things we can remove:

  1. The serviceWorker method from index.js
  
  2. We don't need anything from the App componenet except for the div element (just the div, nothing thats already nested inside it.)

  3. We don't need any of the app CSS (don't delete the file, just the contents)
